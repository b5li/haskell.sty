Haskell for LaTeX2e
===================

Setting large pieces of code in an `verbatim` is ugly and makes it difficult to uses subscripts or set comments in a proportional type face. On the other hand, the use of TeX's math mode requires the use of additional macros to achieve proper kerning in multi-letter identifiers and to typeset application by juxtaposition. The `haskell` style provides environments and macros that simplify setting Haskell programs in LaTeX. While the style is specifically geared towards Haskell, it should also be useful for other functional languages.
